A simple supervised learning solution to classifying candidates according to their professional seniority level (entry, mid, manager, cxo, etc.).

Data processing, model training, inference code, and model evaluation results are in the `SeniorityClassifier.ipynb` notebook.

Check out the `report.md` for instructions to install the code dependencies and to read some of my thoughts on the code/problem.
